          Scope
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Web &amp; Networks Interest Group's scope spans Web and
          Networking technologies that can <strong>enhance the quality of
          experience of web applications</strong>, by exposing Web APIs that
          consider factors such as real-time performance, network throughput indicators, and data transfer latencies while preserving security and privacy requirements,
          and by exposing relevant capabilities in network-profiling developer
          tools.
        </p>
        <p>The scope of the group encompasses both wired and wireless networks.</p>
        <p>
          Topics and areas that are in-scope for the Interest Group include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Application hints to the network</strong> (e.g. ways for applications to declare their operational wishes to the network). Specifically, the group will focus on hints that can
            simultaneously benefit web application and network performance (in
            general-purpose browsers, tablets, phones). For instance:
            <ul>
              <li>Multipath, multi-carrier, multi-connectivity handling;
              </li>
              <li>Latency vs bandwidth tradeoffs, for instance high bandwidth
              4K video stream, or low latency video call, etc.;
              </li>
              <li>Device power and performance balancing.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Exposure of specialized services</strong> such as DiffServ,
            5G Slices, and Edge Computing, including load balancing computing
            between edge devices and the cloud, particularly in
            latency-sensitive applications like Machine Learning inference.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Exposure of aggregated web metrics</strong> beyond application
            developers and browser editors for troubleshooting and monitoring
            purposes: with the encryption of transport protocols (such as in QUIC),
            troubleshooting of network issues through the passive observation
            of transport layer data (such as TCP sequence numbers) is more challenging.
            However, web applications often have access to rich performance
            metrics (e.g. Navigation Timing API; WebRTC getStats API…).
            A new troubleshooting approach would arise if these metrics
            were aggregated according to the network topology, such that any interested
            party (including network operators) is in position to troubleshoot
            possible network-related issues.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The tasks that the Interest Group will undertake include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Identify opportunities for network and application
            collaborations</strong> that seem likely good candidates for
            adoption, analyse them in relation to existing standardization
            efforts, and, when relevant, build the case for additional or
            prioritized standardization.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Liaise and coordinate with relevant networking standards
            organizations</strong> (esp. 3GPP, IETF) to track their
            activities and provide them with relevant use
            cases and requirements from web applications.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Share the latest developments in networking
            standardization bodies</strong>, comprised of telecommunication
            network system vendors and network operators, with the ecosystem of web browsers and
            web application developers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Propose incubation of new work</strong> to identify network-related 
            parameters from different web applications' requirements,
            that can impact the applications networking performance. Also,
            consider work on exposing new Web APIs and new Control Messaging
            between device and network, to leverage various elements in the
            networking path to improve user experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Represent knowledge about networking technologies</strong>
            and gather data about network deployments to support web
            browser developer tools for profiling and performance analysis
            under various network conditions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Provide guidelines to browser developers</strong> on how to
            improve web browser developer tools to profile application user
            experience impact under different network conditions using new
            pre-defined simulation models.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Provide guidelines to web application developers</strong>
            on evaluating trade-offs between compute on edge devices
            versus on cloud for computation-centric operations, to improve
            quality of experience under different radio access type and quality
            conditions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The Interest Group also provides use cases and requirements to guide
          other groups at W3C.

              in the cloud when exposing interactions between Things. The Web &
              Networks IG should coordinate with Web of Things IG to ensure
              future Web of Things work can make use of networking parameters
              that may impact performance.

          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due
          process, per the <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process
          Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant
          makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with
          members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with
          little formal voting being required.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus
          is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views
          presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision
          along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any
          resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face
          meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. A call for
          consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via
          email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week
          to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group
          consensus on the issue. If no objections are raised on the mailing
          list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be
          considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Interest Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless
          and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the
          discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
