          Motivation and Background
        </h2>
        <p>
        New trends are seen in network traffic patterns due to emerging 
          new use-cases that leverage computing resources across device, 
          edge, and cloud that are shaping the focus areas for the Interest Group 
          charter. These trends are leading indicators of the types of next generation 
          applications. This also entail new dependencies and challenges to meet expectations 
          for quality of experience and efficient usage of networking and computing resources.
        </p>
        <p>A few such trends are highlighted below:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
          Offloading capabilities that enable efficient usage of compute across Client-Edge-Cloud is gaining traction in 
            several use-cases. Some of the use-cases are listed in the explainer draft <a href=
          "https://w3c.github.io/edge-computing-web-exploration/">Client-Edge-Cloud coordination Use Cases and Requirements</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
          Uplink traffic data patterns have seen a large increase in data sizes and use-case requirements, which is a 
            shift from the past, where applications data were predominantly in the downlink direction. 
            The <a href="https://www.ericsson.com/49dd9d/assets/local/reports-papers/mobility-report/documents/2023/ericsson-mobility-report-june-2023.pdf">
              Ericsson Mobility Report June 2023</a> highlighted increase in uplink data-intensive 
            content and growth in data consumption. Uplink-demanding services like XR are re-shaping 
            how networks need to be deployed for efficient resource utilization.
          </li>
          <li>
          The <a href="https://www.business.att.com/content/dam/attbusiness/guides/att-network-edge-use-cases.pdf">AT&T Network Edge Use-Cases</a> report lists the trends in new use-cases where Edge Networks can play a key role.
          </li>
          <li>
          To succeed in edge computing, a strategy leveraging the latest networking and web standards will be key. 
            Gartner in its report <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/4263499">Build an Edge Computing Strategy</a> 
          highlights the importance of creating and socializing the vision in the eco-system.
          </li>
          <li>
          New advancements in 6G and AI that can leverage peer-to-peer communications, mesh architectures and sustainable modes of communications 
            will further drive innovations in the Web application space.

          distributed compute and data transfer latencies, while preserving security and privacy requirements.</p>
        <p>The scope of the group encompasses both wired and wireless networks.</p>
        <p>
          Topics and areas that are in-scope for the Interest Group include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
          	<strong>Client-Edge-Cloud Coordination</strong> and evolving next generation use-cases 
            for edge computing, network usage patterns and challenges (e.g., new uplink centric use-cases, 
            graphics distributed rendering, distributed computing, generative AI applications, etc.).
          </li>
          <li>  
            <strong>Application hints to the network</strong> (e.g. ways for applications to 
            declare their operational wishes to the network). Specifically, the group will 
            focus on hints (e.g., QoS, user perception metrics) that can be used to optimize 
            network resource allocation and performance achieve best web application and 
            network performance. For instance:
            <ul>
              <li>Latency vs bandwidth trade-offs, for instance high bandwidth
              4K video stream, or low latency video call, etc.
              </li>
              <li>Prediction based hints for look-ahead network resource planning, balancing and allocation.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Network hints to device applications</strong> to enable migration of compute 
            functions across the network between client, edge or cloud depending on user experience 
            and compute requirements, and improved resource utilization.
          </li>
          <li>

              Web of Things depends on networking technologies on the edge and in 
              the cloud when exposing interactions between Things, which can also include 
              Edge devices. The Web & Networks IG should coordinate with Web of Things IG to 
              ensure future work considers networking parameters that impact communication and 
              performance in both IoT and edge compute offload like use-cases. The group should 
              also evaluate extending Thing Description for Edge Compute Devices.

          Decision Policy

        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due
          process, per the <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process
          Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant
          makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with
          members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with
          little formal voting being required.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus
          is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views
          presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision
          along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any
          resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face
          meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. A call for
          consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via
          email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week
          to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group
          consensus on the issue. If no objections are raised on the mailing
          list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be
          considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Interest Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless
          and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the
          discretion of the Chairs.
